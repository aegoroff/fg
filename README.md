fg
==

A small commandline app written in Go that allows you to easily group
all files in the dir specified into several child subdirectories.
Grouping uses file modification time or file name and may be converted into day, month
or year in the form yyyy-dd-mm or yyyy-mm or yyyy. Also you can group files by file extension and first 3 letters of the file name. This can be specified
using command line option.
